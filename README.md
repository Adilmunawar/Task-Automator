## üõ† **Installation Instructions**

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
To get started, first clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adilmunawar/Task-Automator.git
cd Task-Automator
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**
This project requires Python 3.x and some external libraries. To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> The `requirements.txt` includes the following libraries:
> - `tqdm` for progress bars
> - `google-auth`, `google-api-python-client` for Google Drive API
> - `dropbox` for Dropbox integration
> - `hashlib` for file integrity checks
> - `PIL` for metadata extraction from images
> - `schedule` for task automation
> - `tkinter` for the graphical user interface

### 3. **API Keys**
To use Google Drive and Dropbox backups, you will need to obtain the necessary API keys:

- [Get Google Drive API credentials](https://developers.google.com/drive)
- [Get Dropbox API credentials](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create)

### 4. **Configuration**
Update the `config.json` file with your API keys and file categories configuration. Example:

```json
{
    "google_drive_api_key": "YOUR_GOOGLE_DRIVE_API_KEY",
    "dropbox_access_token": "YOUR_DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "categories": {
        "Images": [".jpg", ".png", ".gif"],
        "Documents": [".pdf", ".txt", ".docx"],
        "Videos": [".mp4", ".avi"]
    }
}
```

## üìà **Project Architecture**

1. **Main Logic**: The main logic is in the `organizer.py` file, which:
   - Organizes files based on extensions.
   - Backs up files to cloud services (Google Drive, Dropbox).
   - Verifies file integrity using hash comparison.
   - Sends email notifications upon completion.

2. **Configuration File**: The `config.json` file stores:
   - API keys for Google Drive and Dropbox.
   - File categories and their corresponding extensions.

3. **GUI**: The `Tkinter` GUI in `gui.py` allows users to select folders and monitor the progress.

---

## üß∞ **Advanced Features**

- **Cloud Backup**: Files are backed up to both Google Drive and Dropbox using their respective APIs.
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple files are processed in parallel, making the tool faster.
- **Error Handling**: Errors during file operations are logged, and the system retries failed operations.
- **Scheduling**: Using the `schedule` module, you can automate the task to run at specified intervals.
- **Metadata Extraction**: For images, the tool can extract EXIF data like camera settings, location, and more.

---

## üìß **Email Notifications**

This tool sends an email notification once the file organization is complete. The email contains:

- **Total Files Processed**
- **Files Moved**
- **Skipped Files (based on size/date)**
- **Errors Encountered**

You can configure your email sender and receiver details in the code.

---

## üì¶ **File Categories**

The tool automatically categorizes files into various categories based on their extensions:

- **Images**: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.
- **Videos**: `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mkv`, etc.
- **Documents**: `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.docx`, etc.
- **Audios**: `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.aac`, etc.
- **Archives**: `.zip`, `.tar`, `.rar`, `.7z`, etc.

---

## üîÑ **Task Scheduling**

To schedule the file organization task, use the `schedule` module and add a cron job to run the Python script at specific intervals.

Example:

```python
import schedule
import time

def job():
    print("Running File Organization Task...")
    os.system("python organizer.py")

# Schedule the task every day at 3 AM
schedule.every().day.at("03:00").do(job)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(60)
```
